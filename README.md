### Hello! 👋🏻

I am a software engineer and erstwhile engineering manager and director.

My work has primarily involved internet-facing \*aaS—delivered software,
with an emphasis on e-commerce, communication, and infrastructure
products

#### Technical (Coding & System Design) Interview Practice

Are you preparing for technical interviews? I'd be happy to run a practice interview (schedules permitting) [schedule a time](https://calendly.com/watters) or reach out via [Twitter] (DMs are open).
