### Hello üëãüèª

#### Technical (Coding & System Design) Interview Practice

Are you preparing for technical interviews? I'd be happy to run a practice interview (schedules permitting); reach out via [Twitter] (DMs are open), [LinkedIn] if you're interested.

#### Hire Me!

I'm actively looking for a my next **hands-on senior engineering role**.

Don't hesitate to reach out via [Twitter] (DMs are open), [LinkedIn] or email: me at cameronwatters.com

#### Technical Background

My expertise centers around‚Äî

- loosely coupled, independently deliverable multi-service architecture design and delivery (e.g. "microservices" and other service-oriented approaches) for SaaS products
- continuous delivery
- engineering/operations collaborative end-to-end service operations ("DevOps")

In particular, my focus for most of the past decade has involved refactoring tightly coupled systems into more modular, loosely coupled architectures and replatforming them with more contemporary infrastructure approaches.

My resume has a [longer (but still not exhaustive) list](https://cameronwatters.com/resume/index.html#skills) of technologies I've worked with, but here's a short list of the tools I've spent the most time with:

- Java
- C#/.NET
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
‚Äì Microsoft SQL Server
- Redis
