### Hello! 👋🏻

I am a software engineer (and erstwhile engineering manager and director).

My work has primarily involved internet-facing \*aaS—delivered software,
with an emphasis on e-commerce, communication, and infrastructure
products

#### Technical (Coding & System Design) Interview Practice

Are you preparing for technical interviews? I'd be happy to facilitate a practice
